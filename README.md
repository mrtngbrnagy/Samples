# Samples
These are code samples from my private repo and past work, shared for job applications.

## FFB-Controller
This is a currently ongoing hobby project. Mostly things related to serial communication with the configurator (Python, TKinter, not included) and a class that calculates emulated countersteering effects. Very WIP.

## Java game from 2010
Probably not very relevant, this is how I started with programming in 2010.

## Planner
Small excerpt from a spike branch that was never used in the production planner. This is what a WIP code looks for me, with notes-to-self included. Original file is ~2.5k lines.

## Python
Old python script for clustering imaging spectroscopy data

## Leetcode
One of my very over-commented solutions from Leetcode (median of two sorted arrays in O(log(N))).
